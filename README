EventEmitter-Promise
====================

From node-promise:

	Promises provide a clean separation of concerns between asynchronous
	behavior and the interface so asynchronous functions can be called without
	callbacks, and callback interaction can be done on the generic promise
	interface.

The practical outcome is that code dealing with the result of an asynchronous
function can be defined in the source after the call to that function. This has
a two-fold benefit 1) the code is laid in its logical order and 2) the hell
of callbacks-within-callbacks can be unwrapped.

This module aims to be a minimalist implementation of promises, based on the
node-promise API.
